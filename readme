There are two interacting cellular automata (CA).

Both CA use ECA rules.
Can run all possible ECA with the RegularCA class.
This runs all possible initial rules and states for a single ECA.

The InteractingCA class that each of the two interacting CA will change their update rule after each timestep.
The rule that changes the update rule is called the interaction rule.
There are four types of interaction rule function that depends on different inputs of current states:
1. states of both ca
2. state of the first ca
3. state of the second ca
4. a random choice from the above three

Each of these rules types is exhaustively explored over all possible initial conditions.
Interaction rules are generated as random mappings between states and rules.
Both CA use the same rule type at once, but not the same mapping.

The state trajectories (always including the initial state) are run for 2(2^w)+1 timesteps.
